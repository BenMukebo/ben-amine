				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
					is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
					example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
					its environment to provide programmatic control over them. <br />

					JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
					Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
					control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
					for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
					for example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
						For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
						elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
						clicks, form input, and page navigation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
						server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
						database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
						another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
						server.
					</li>
				</ul>

					JavaScript and Java
				</head>
				<p>
					JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
					different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
					does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
					JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
					basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
					from LiveScript to JavaScript. <br />

					In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
					declarations,JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
					number of data typesrepresenting numeric, Boolean, and string values.
					JavaScript has aprototype-based object model instead of the more
					common class-based objectmodel. The prototype-based model provides
					dynamic inheritance; that is, whatis inherited can vary for individual
					objects. JavaScript also supportsfunctions without any special
					declarative requirements. Functions can beproperties of objects,
					executing as loosely typed methods. <br />

					JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
					have todeclare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
					be concernedwith whether methods are public, private, or protected,
					and you do not have toimplement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
					function return types are notexplicitly typed.

					Hello world
				</head>
				<p>
					To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
					your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
				</p>
				<span>
					function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
					greetMe("World");
				</span>
				<p>
					Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
					browser!

					Variables
				</head>
				<p>
					You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
					The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
					A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
					dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
					Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
					"A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
					(lowercase). You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü
					in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
					characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
					Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
