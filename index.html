                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                    Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces.
                    Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <header>while statement</header>
            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.<br> The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement
                is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.<br> To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those <br>                Example:

                <br> The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
            <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>
                        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                    </li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                </ul>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After completing the third pass, the condition n
                < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="function declarations">
            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <p>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
            </p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the
                function.
            </p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
